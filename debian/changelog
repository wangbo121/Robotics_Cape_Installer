roboticscape (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

    * complete rewrite and overhaul
    * move all docs to doxygen
    * all subsystems are now in independent headers
    * move gpio to new device driver
    * move ADC from mmap to iio
    * deprecate rc_initialize(), new functions for handling PID files/signals
    * most examples no longer require root
    * all examples are dependent on single subsystems for portability
    * pwm through driver instead of mmap
    * mpu9250 IMU config allows custom gpio pin and address
    * button interface allows custom buttons
    * uart interface allows config on initialization
    * add mavlink interface over udp
    * add PRU interface for custom PRU binary loading
    * split encoder counting on eqep and pru to avoid conflicts
    * cpu frequency interface now controls scheduler
    * LED interface controls battery LEDs, USR, and WIFI leds
    * various renaming and fixes in math lib
    * single include for all math sub-libs
    * new pthread helpers
    * servo interface now has same function to handle one and all channels
    * battery monitor has startup and power-change flash patterns
    * roboticscape systemd service helps set permissions of device drivers
    * project template demonstrates PID file and signal handling
    * new rc_test_esc example
    * new makefile for examples means all src files can be in same folder
    * all makefiles keep src/bin folders separate
